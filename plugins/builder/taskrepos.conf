    you want to use yum repository. You can install required certificates from:
    * http://hdn.corp.redhat.com/rhel7-csb-stage/repoview/redhat-internal-cert-install.html (rpm)
    * https://certs.corp.redhat.com/ (cert files)

    The repository will be available for the next %%(repolifetime)s days.
    Scratch build output will be deleted earlier, based on the Brew scratch build retention policy.
